# image processing
HW1
1. Generate a 512x512 raw image, each row of which is a smooth ramp r(n).

2. Using the raw image generated in the problem 1, generate a BMP (bitmap) image file.

3. Rotate the image obtained in number 1 90 degrees to the counter-clockwise and store it properly in BMP format as you did in 2. 

HW2
1. Using the BMP image “Lena.bmp” of 8 bit gray-scale.

2. Perform Histogram Equalization.

3. Perform Basic Contrast Stretching and then plot the histogram. Discuss any difference when compared to the result of (2).

4. Perform Ends-in Contrast Stretching with low-end value of 50 and high-end value of 190, and then plot the histogram. Discuss any difference when compared to the result of (3).

HW3
1. Compare the performance of the gradient operators of Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt and the 5x5 stochastic gradient on a noisy image with SNR= 8dB.

HW4
1. Implement DCT algorithm for a given still image. In order to evaluate the performance, we can compare the subjective quality reconstructed by inverse transform as well as the objective criterion such as MSE (mean square error). Furthermore, we can exploit the frequency spectrum in which the energy compaction performance could be compared.

(a) Perform 8x8 forward DCT and plot the frequency spectrum on the monitor in proper scale for easy observation.

(b) Perform 8x8 inverse DCT to obtain the reconstructed image. Compute the MSE.
